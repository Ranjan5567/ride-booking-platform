1. AWS INFRASTRUCTURE:
"Create AWS architecture: EKS cluster with 4 microservices (User 8001, Driver 8002, Ride 8003 with HPA 2-10 pods, Payment 8004), RDS PostgreSQL, Lambda+API Gateway, S3, Prometheus/Grafana. Show connections. Use AWS orange colors."

---

2. GCP INFRASTRUCTURE:
"Create GCP architecture: Dataproc cluster (Master + 2 Workers) with Flink, Pub/Sub topics (ride-booking-rides, ride-booking-ride-results), Firestore database (ride-booking-analytics), Cloud Storage. Show data flow. Use GCP blue colors."

---

3. CROSS-CLOUD FLOW:
"Create flow diagram: AWS Ride Service → GCP Pub/Sub → Dataproc Flink → Firestore → AWS Ride Service → Frontend. Show AWS orange, GCP blue, label communication methods."

---

4. MICROSERVICES:
"Create microservices diagram: Frontend (Next.js) connects to 4 services in EKS (User, Driver, Ride orchestrator, Payment). Ride Service calls Payment, Lambda, Pub/Sub, Firestore. Show all connections with protocols."

---

5. DATA FLOW:
"Create sequence diagram: User → Frontend → Ride Service → RDS → Payment Service → Lambda → Pub/Sub → Flink → Firestore → Frontend. Show 16 steps with async operations marked."

---

6. DEPLOYMENT:
"Create deployment diagram: Terraform (AWS + GCP modules) → Cloud Resources → Kubernetes EKS → ArgoCD GitOps → Application Services + Monitoring Stack. Show GitOps workflow."

---

7. SCALABILITY:
"Create HPA diagram: Load Balancer → 3 Ride Service Pods → HPA Controller (5% CPU target) → Scale Up/Down decision. Show min 2, max 10 replicas, feedback loop."

---

8. HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW:
"Create overview: Frontend → AWS (EKS, RDS, Lambda) and GCP (Dataproc, Pub/Sub, Firestore). Show cross-cloud connection. Use orange for AWS, blue for GCP."
